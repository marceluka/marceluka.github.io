Here I am, again, running. Following a 6 week plan to improve my 5K time.

I started running again a couple of months ago, without a goal in mind. I just wanted to run again. Pretty quickly I realized that I was having trouble, the kind of trouble that one experiences when running for the very first time. For me, that was back in 2013. I ran sort of consistently since then until mid-2016 when I finished gradschool and moved north. August 2017, after a couple of months of training I finished my first and only half-marathon and stopped running for two years. August 2019, after a couple of weeks of training, I finished a 5k and stopped running once again. As summer of 2020 rolled around I found myself on the road, struggling to breathe, unable to run. Three years of minimum running will naturally take everything away.

So….here I am, again, running. On July 19 I tested my 5k time to have a start point, 35 mins and 11 secs. My personal best is 30 mins and 52 secs and I ran it back in 2013. In 2019 I clocked in at 31 mins 17 secs. I’m following a plan to improve on that, mainly to have strucutre and a goal. Hopefully the running comes back somewhere along the road.

At the end of week 1 I was able to log 4 runs which amount to a total distance of 8.6 mi and an average pace of 12:16 min/mi. Yay!

Will be back with more.

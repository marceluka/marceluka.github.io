Week 2 summary

Run 1 - 28 mins easy - 2.09 mi, 13:32 min/mi
This one was slow. So slow, and still not so easy. I was so glad it was over. I'm gonna start incorporating strides after these so called easy runs. Just so that I feel like I actually did some running. I was also going back and forth between what "easy" meant. Is it perceived effort? Should it be heart rate based? Should I just forget it and run? It didn't actually matter that much, I just could not keep up. I do think I need to make a decision on what "easy" will be, so moving forward I'm gonna forget about HR and go by perceived effort.

Yoga session 1 - 47 mins
This yoga class was just what I needed. All the components that make up my body had a chance to elongate and relax. It was an easy session, super sweaty, tired and sore, but so worth it. After having to take a break from it, my yoga is back, like really back.

Run 2 - 10min easy + 4x90sec brisk:2.5min jog + 10min easy - 2.84 mi, 12:09 min/mi
What a great day. Felt so much better, even felt fast. Ran the warm up with a pace of 12:34 mi/min, then the intervals at 10:14, 9:58, 9:49, 9:44, and the cool down at 12:08. Not bad at all. I did tie my shoes a little too tight so my feet got cranky but we made it.

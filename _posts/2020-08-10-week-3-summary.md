Week 3 was a good one. Here are the stats shown in the format - this week (last week):  
Number of runs: 3 (3)  
Distance: 7.8 (8.2) mi    
Pace: 11:40 (12:34) min/mi   

Same number of runs as last week but faster and the easy run on Sat actually felt easy which my HR confirmed. Two sessions of yoga in, a bike ride and a strenght workout this week. I guess all of that left my legs a bit tired, which I felt on Sun morning so instead of going for my easy run that day I went on a hike and ran a little bit at the end.

All in all, a pretty good week. I expect week 4 will finally be 4 runs and increased mpw.  

Here is the day to day breakdown--  

Tue: Run 1 - 30 mins easy - 2.62 mi, 11:29 min/mi  

Wed: Yoga session 1 - [Vinyasa flow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfcMiYVsoAw) - 47 mins  
     Also went on a bike ride - 6.6 mi

Thu: Run 2 - 10 mins easy + 25 mins fartlek - 2.98 mi, 11:38 min/mi

Fri: Yoga session 2 - [Power hour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwdgV8aiNyQ&t=2557s) - 40 mins  
     Also did a strength training workout following some example exercises from [James Dunne](https://www.youtube.com/user/RunningRevolution) on Youtube

Sat: Run 3 - 25 mins easy - 2.15 mi, 11:54 min/mi 

Sun: Skipped the planned 40 min easy run and instead went on a hike that lasted 1hr 55mins, covering 5.16 mi


Will be back with more.
